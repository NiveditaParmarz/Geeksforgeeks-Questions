class Solution {
    public int findExtra(int n, int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        // add code here.
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr2.length - 1;
        int index = n - 1; // n is the larger index that arr2 doesn't have. So in case loop finishes, the ans will be last index of arr1. which is n.
       
       
        while(lo<=hi){
            int mid = (lo+hi)/2;
            if(arr1[mid]==arr2[mid]){
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                index = mid; //because as the 2 elements are not equal, that index can also be of the extra element.
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
